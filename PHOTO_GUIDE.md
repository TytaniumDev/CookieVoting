# 📸 Taking the Perfect Cookie Photo

To ensure the best possible automatic cookie detection, follow these simple tips when taking photos of your cookie tray.

## 1. High Contrast is Key!
The AI needs to clearly see where the cookie ends and the tray begins.
*   **Good**: Light cookies on a dark tray (or vice versa).
*   **Bad**: Tan cookies on a wooden table or beige parchment paper.
*   **Fix**: Place a solid colored cloth or paper (black, white, or blue) under the cookies if the tray color is too similar.

## 2. Even Lighting
Shadows can look like cookies or hide the edges of real cookies.
*   **Best**: Natural daylight from a window.
*   **Good**: Overhead kitchen lights (if not too dim).
*   **Avoid**: Flash photography (creates harsh shadows) or dim candlelight.

## 3. Spacing
Give them some personal space!
*   **Keep cookies separate**. If they touch, the AI might think they are one giant mega-cookie.
*   Leave at least 1/2 inch (1-2 cm) between cookies.

## 4. Angle
*   **Shoot straight down** (bird's-eye view).
*   Angled shots distort the shapes and make cropping less accurate.

## 5. Clean Background
*   Remove other objects (forks, napkins, sprinkles jars) from the frame. The AI might think a spoon is a very thin cookie!

### Example Setup
> **Top Tip**: Use a dark baking sheet for sugar cookies, or a white serving platter for chocolate cookies. The contrast makes all the difference!
