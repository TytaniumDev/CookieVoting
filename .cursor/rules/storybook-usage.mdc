# Agent Instructions for Storybook Usage and UI Component Development

## Modular UI Component Best Practices with Storybook.js

When developing or modifying UI components:

1. **ALWAYS Build in Storybook First**
   - All new UI components and widgets MUST be created and thoroughly tested in Storybook BEFORE integration into the application.
   - Use the built-in browser to interactively verify **all behaviors** and **visuals** in Storybook.

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI components should be **modular** and **reusable**.
   - **Do NOT include business logic** (e.g., data fetching, external side effects) inside reusable components.
   - Components should accept all necessary state or data via props and should not depend on global state or app-specific logic.

3. **Testability**
   - **All component states must be demonstrable in Storybook.**
   - If your component has disabled, error, loading, empty, selected, or interactive states, **create a dedicated Story for each one**.
   - Stories should cover:
     - Default/initial state
     - Loading and error states (if applicable)
     - Edge cases and empty values
     - Variations (e.g., different sizes, themes, disabled, etc.)
   - Avoid requiring custom story args to "trigger" states during review – instead, provide explicit named stories.

4. **Reusability**
   - Components and stories must be designed for maximal reusability.
   - Any UI logic shared by multiple components should be extracted into helpers or lower-level components.
   - Use TypeScript interfaces and composition to enable reuse, not duplication.

5. **Visual and Functional Review**
   - Use the browser with Storybook to verify component accessibility, responsiveness, and intended visual design.
   - Only after all Storybook states pass, integrate and test within the main application.

6. **Storybook Maintenance**
   - When updating a component's API or visuals, also update affected stories.
   - Remove obsolete stories and add new ones for new states or variants.

## Summary for the Agent

- **NEVER** skip the Storybook stage for UI widgets.
- Ensure all UX and state permutations are covered in dedicated stories.
- Prioritize clarity, modularity, and reusability.
- No business logic inside UI components – keep concerns separated.

**Reminder:** You must verify, using Storybook and the built-in browser, that all UI widgets work as described and are easy for others to test via their stories.
