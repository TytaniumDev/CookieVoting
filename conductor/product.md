# Product Guide - Cookie Voting 🍪

## Initial Concept

A modern web application for managing and voting on cookie competitions. This application uses AI-powered cookie detection, Firebase for backend services, and React for the frontend.

## Product Vision

Cookie Voting aims to revolutionize cookie competitions by replacing manual tallying with a fast and visually engaging digital experience. The system streamlines the entire event lifecycle—from the moment an admin uploads a photo of a tray of cookies to the final, celebratory reveal of the winners.

## Target Audience

- **Event Administrators:** Organizers who manage the competition, configure events, and upload/tag cookie images. They are required to be signed in to access administrative tools.
- **Voters:** Participants at live events who browse cookie images and cast their votes. They can participate immediately without needing to create an account or log in, ensuring a frictionless experience.

## Primary Goals

- **Automated Efficiency:** Leverage technology to automatically detect, crop, and tag individual cookies from group tray photos, significantly reducing administrative overhead.
- **Seamless Management:** Provide a robust admin dashboard for managing bakers, events, and categories, making it easy to link specific cookie images to their creators.
- **Real-Time Engagement:** Deliver live voting capabilities and real-time result visualizations that include attribution to the bakers who made the winning cookies.

## Key Features

- **Smart & Manual Cropping:** A hybrid workflow combining AI detection with "butter smooth" manual tools (drag-to-create, resize handles) for precise cookie isolation.
- **Category-Based Voting:** A flexible system where voters can choose their favorites across multiple distinct categories (e.g., "Most Creative," "Best Classic," "Best Overall").
- **Admin Management Suite:** Comprehensive tools for baker management, event configuration, and category tagging.
- **Real-Time Results & Reveal:** A results engine that tallies votes live, with a "reveal" feature that allows admins to control exactly when winners are announced to the crowd.

## Functional Requirements

- **Multi-Event Support:** Admins can manage multiple independent events, each with its own unique set of categories, bakers, and cookie entries.
- **Mobile-First Voting:** The voting interface is optimized for speed and ease of use on mobile devices, accommodating the typical environment of a live event.
- **Admin Authentication:** Strict authentication for administrative functions to ensure event integrity.
- **Flexible Attribution:** Intuitive workflows for assigning a baker to each detected cookie image.

## User Experience Goals

- **Visually Engaging:** Focus on high-quality cookie imagery and polished UI elements that emphasize the "celebratory" nature of the competition.
- **Frictionless Participation:** Minimize barriers for voters, allowing them to participate instantly via simple navigation.
- **Anticipation & Reveal:** Use the managed results "reveal" time to build excitement and provide a satisfying conclusion to the event.
