# Product Guidelines - Cookie Voting 🍪

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Playful & Celebratory:** The application should feel fun and welcoming. Use lighthearted language, appropriate emojis (🍪, 🎉, 🏆), and enthusiastic messaging to match the social nature of a cookie competition.
- **Inclusive & Encouraging:** Ensure all bakers feel appreciated, regardless of the results.
- **Clear & Energetic:** Instructions should be simple but energetic, guiding users through the voting process with excitement.

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Modern & Vibrant:** Use a bright, appetizing color palette (warm cookie tones mixed with vibrant accents).
- **Design Elements:** Rounded corners, soft shadows, and smooth transitions to create a polished, modern feel.
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif fonts for readability, potentially paired with a playful display font for headings to add character.

## User Interface & Layout
- **Grid-Based Image Presentation:** Display cookie images in a clean, uniform grid layout. This facilitates easy comparison and efficient browsing, especially on mobile devices.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Prioritize touch targets and swipe gestures, ensuring the experience is seamless for users holding a phone in one hand and a cookie in the other.
- **Consistent Imagery:** Ensure a uniform aspect ratio for cropped cookie images to maintain the grid's visual rhythm.

## Interaction Design
- **Frictionless Voting:** Voting actions should be immediate and satisfying (e.g., a "heart" animation or a satisfying "click" feedback).
- **Results Reveal Experience:**
    - **Celebratory:** Use fun animations (like confetti) and digital medals (🥇, 🥈, 🥉) to highlight the winners.
    - **Data-Centric:** Complement the celebration with clear charts and graphs that visualize the vote distribution, offering transparency and insight into the competition's outcome.
    - **Staged Reveal:** Consider revealing results category by category to build anticipation.

## Accessibility
- **Color Contrast:** Ensure text and interactive elements meet WCAG AA standards, especially within the vibrant color palette.
- **Alt Text:** Provide mechanisms for describing cookie images for screen reader users.
- **Clear Indicators:** Use more than just color to indicate state changes (e.g., selected votes, errors).
