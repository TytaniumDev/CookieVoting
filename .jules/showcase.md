# SHOWCASE'S JOURNAL

## Friction Points & Observations

- **Missing Hero Image:** (Resolved) The README lacked a high-quality screenshot. I've added `scripts/generate-hero.js` to automate the creation of `public/hero.png` using the emulator, ensuring it's always up-to-date.
- **Missing Architecture Doc:** The `README.md` and memory referenced `docs/ARCHITECTURE_TECHNICAL.md`, but it does not exist. I've updated the links to point to the `Technical Architecture` section in `docs/PRD.md` instead. This discrepancy should be resolved by Scribe creating the dedicated doc.
