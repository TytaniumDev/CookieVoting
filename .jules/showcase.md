# SHOWCASE'S JOURNAL

## Friction Points & Observations

- **Missing Hero Image:** The README currently lacks a high-quality screenshot or GIF of the application (e.g., the dashboard or voting interface). This significantly reduces "Curb Appeal" and fails to give users an immediate visual understanding of the product. A placeholder has been added, but a real image needs to be prioritized.

## Learnings

- **Automated Hero Generation:** Using a Playwright script (`scripts/generate-hero.js`) to automatically generate the hero image ensures the README always reflects the current UI state without manual intervention. This significantly reduces maintenance overhead for visual assets.
