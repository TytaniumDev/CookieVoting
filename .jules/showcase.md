# SHOWCASE'S JOURNAL

## Friction Points & Observations

- **Missing Hero Image:** The README currently lacks a high-quality screenshot or GIF of the application (e.g., the dashboard or voting interface). This significantly reduces "Curb Appeal" and fails to give users an immediate visual understanding of the product. A placeholder has been added, but a real image needs to be prioritized.
- **Missing Hero Script:** The memory states that `scripts/generate-hero.js` exists and uses Playwright to generate the hero image, but the file is missing from the repository. This discrepancy prevents automated hero image generation.
- **Placeholder Usage:** `public/test-cookies.jpg` is currently used as a placeholder hero image. While it shows the "subject matter" (cookies), it does not show the "product" (the UI). This should be replaced with a real screenshot as soon as possible.
